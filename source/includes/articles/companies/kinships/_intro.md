# <a name="company_kinships_intro"></a>Articles: Company Kinships

Kinships are relationships between companies, e.g. ownership or division. Each kinship is between two companies, the parent and the child.

These resources include separate routes for indexing and creating parent kinships (`/articles/companies/{company-id}/parents`) and child kinships (`/articles/companies/{company-id}/children`) for a given company. A single common route is used for showing, updating, and deleting existing kinship records (`/articles/company_kinships/{id}`).
