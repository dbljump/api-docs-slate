# <a name="places_intro"></a>Places

Resources related to places.

`/places` includes all place records: [regions](#regions_intro) (i.e. groups of countries), [countries](#countries_intro), [subdivisions](#subdivs_intro) (e.g. states and counties), and [localities](#localities_intro) (e.g. cities and towns).

[Region](#regions_intro), [country](#countries_intro), [subdivision](#subdivs_intro), and [locality](#localities_intro) records must be created, updated, and deleted via their own model-specific routes.
